Steps I have applied:

1.First we have to get data.
2.Then, we have to choose text/CSV file to extract data.
3.We have to undertstand the data and analyze the data once,so that it is easy for us to create the visualiztaion in dashboard.
4.Then we have to clean the data like deleting unnecessary rows or columns and we have to check for errors if there are errors we should clear the errors.
5.After clearing the errors,we should save the new data by clicking on close and apply,then we have to prepare the data for dashboard view.
6.There are number of ways of viewing the data such as Report view,data view,model view.
7.The first visualization that i used here is the sum of sales by Card View.
8.Then followed by Sum of sales by category followed by sum of discount by category.
9.I have analysed the based on Sum of sales,Sum of profit,Sum of quantity sold,Sum of profit by category.
10.We can visual all the data from this dashboard itself.
